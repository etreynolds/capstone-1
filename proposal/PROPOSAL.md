# Capstone I Proposal -- Media Memoir

## Overview

The *Media Memoir* is an application that will allow users to register, login, keep a log of movies and tv shows they watch, see information about the movies and tv shows they watch, and view watch summaries and statistics. The [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) provides access to a wealth of information and data points on movies and tv shows that will be utilited.

## Goals

The goal of the website is to create a sort of online journal for users that want to look back and remember what and how many movies and tv shows they've watched. With the ever increasing availability of movies and tv shows to watch on countless streaming services, people are watching many different things without a single place to log and keep track of their viewing histories.

## Target Users

The target demographic is primarily fans of movies and tv shows, obviously with Netflix addicts sprinkled in. Basically, anyone curious about their viewing history is who this is built for.

## Data

I plan on using the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) and/or the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/). I plan on pulling main data points relevant to movies/tv shows (title, rating, genre, runtime, release date, etc.)

## Approach

### DB Schema
